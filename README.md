DISCRIPTION TASK 5: YOLOv8-Powered AI System for Vehicle Damage Detection and Insurance Evaluation
This AI-driven system leverages YOLOv8 and computer vision to automatically detect vehicle damages such as dents, scratches and broken parts from car images. It analyzes the severity of damage (Minor, Moderate, Major) and intelligently predicts whether the vehicle is eligible for an insurance claim, helping to make the claim process faster, fairer and more efficient.

How It Works:
Upload a car image through an interactive interface.
The YOLOv8 model performs real-time detection and segmentation of damaged areas.
A rule-based AI engine calculates a severity score based on the damage type and area.
The system classifies the damage level and provides an insurance claim recommendation (Claimable/Not Claimable).

Tech Stack:
YOLOv8: Object detection and segmentation
Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib): Image processing and visualization
Jupyter Notebook(VS Code) and ipywidgets: Interactive upload and result display
Rule-Based AI System: Severity scoring and claim evaluation logic

Outcome:
The project demonstrates how AI and automation can transform the insurance and automotive sectors by reducing manual inspection time and improving claim accuracy. It delivers an efficient, explainable and scalable approach to vehicle damage assessment and insurance claim prediction.
